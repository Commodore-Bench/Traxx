# Traxx

With thanks to OSK (Old Skool Coder) i now have a working assmebly source code

See OSK Folder and the source is TraXX_Kick.asm

load into kick assembler and run on an 8K+ vic20

My attempt at reverse engineering Traxx by Llamasoft (Jeff Minter)

.ASM files are 6502 assembely files in kick assembler format.

.INF files are infultrater dissassembly files.

.BIN binary files created by infiltrater.


this is a work in progress it is not full sourse code ready to be assembled.


traxx_RE.kick.asm is the Reversed Engineered code to run.

1201-1fff is data inc, charset but what else idk yet.

2000-3fff is the main game code, with data scattered about inside the code this is as far as i got so far.
